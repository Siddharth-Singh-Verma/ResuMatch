## Overview
ResuMatch addresses the challenge of efficiently matching resumes to job descriptions by systematically exploring and integrating:
- **Rule-Based Techniques:** Exact keyword and skill matching.
- **Traditional Machine Learning:** Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for improved accuracy.
- **Deep Learning & GenAI:** Advanced NLP models (BERT, GPT) and generative AI for nuanced analysis and suggestions.

The platform evaluates these approaches to determine the most effective method for automated hiring systems, ultimately delivering a GenAI-powered solution for job-resume compatibility.

## Features
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Keyword Matching:** Identify critical keywords from the job description that match or are missing from your resume.
- ‚ö° **Smart Suggestions:** Get tailored recommendations to improve your resume for specific job positions.
- üìà **Match Score Analysis:** Receive a comprehensive score showing how well your qualifications align with job requirements.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Grammar Check:** Eliminate spelling and grammar mistakes that could cost you an interview.
- üìä **Detailed Results:** Visual match score, improvement tips, and error highlights.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Your Resume:** Upload a PDF or paste your resume text.
2. **Add Job Description:** Paste the job description you're interested in.
3. **Analyze Match:** The AI compares your resume against the job requirements.
4. **Get Results:** Receive a match percentage, actionable tips, and grammar corrections.

## Approach
This project began with rule-based matching, progressed through traditional ML models, and culminated in a GenAI-powered solution. The GenAI approach leverages advanced NLP to:
- Compare resume and job description content semantically
- Provide a match percentage
- Suggest improvements
- Detect grammatical errors
